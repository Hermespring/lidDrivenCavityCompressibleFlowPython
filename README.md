# lidDrivenCavityCompressibleFlowPython
A programming exercise. Should work. Solves compressible flow in 2d lid driven cavity. Pure python + numpy etc. Contains test data from Ghia et al (1982) 

2d lid driven cavity for compressible flow

Creates a "plot.jpeg" and a "ghia.jpeg" containing the most 
interesting visualization. Example files should be included. 

This code was written as a part of a CFD course on turbulence and DNS 
given at AALTO university, Finland, in 2015. Being a course exercise 
this code was never rigorously tested but according to the test data by
Ghia et al. (1982) (function ghia in this code) it works fine. I'm just 
publicing this out of a habit. Someone might find it useful while learning 
Python. A short presentation given on the subject containing some of the 
equations should be included.

Lisence: DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. A Citation would be appreciated.
